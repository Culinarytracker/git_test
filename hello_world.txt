ok, this is a line of text in the hello world .txt file. 
I just typed $ edit hello_world.txt then this cmd line editor popped up. 

And now I am typing another line of text in this file 4 years later. 

Funny huh. I had to google how to get out of this editor. 

And now I am doing it again another 2 years later. Funny huh. I'm going to guess about how to exit this editor now.
